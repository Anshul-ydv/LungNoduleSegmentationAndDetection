### ü´Å Lung Nodule Segmentation and Detection

This project focuses on the automated detection of pulmonary nodules in CT scans using the LUNA16 dataset. We employ:

* **U-Net** for precise segmentation of lung nodules.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for classification and false positive reduction.

The goal is to build an end-to-end pipeline that accurately segments nodules and classifies candidates to aid in early lung cancer detection.

#### üì¶ Dataset

We use the publicly available **LUNA16 (LUng Nodule Analysis 2016)** dataset:

* [LUNA16 Part 1 ‚Äì Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/3723295)
* [LUNA16 Part 2 ‚Äì Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4121926)

Please download both parts and extract them before running the preprocessing and training notebooks.

#### How to proceed

I am using both Vscode and Google colab(Just for TPU).
